LRAS1130_PI

This project allows applications that are written for the Boldport Club's "TheMatrix"
board controlled by Arduino using Lucky Resistor's awesome LRAS1130 API, to be 
run on a board that is controlled by a Raspberry Pi, with absolute NO modification 
to the original LRAS1130 project or application.  LRAS1130_PI provides an Arduino-like 
framework that works along with the original LRAS1130 project. The current 
version provides "Wire" and "Serial" libraries (based on the fantastic "wiringPi"
library) that run on the Pi.  You will need both the wiringPi library and Lucky
Resistor's LRAS1130 API project.

Procedure:

 1.  Install the wiringPi library.  You can get it and instructions on how to 
     install it at wiringpi.com.

 2.  Clone Lucky Resistor's LRAS1130 project:
       git clone https://github.com/LuckyResistor/LRAS1130

 3.  Add lras1130_pi to the original lras1130 project:
       cd LRAS1130
       git clone https://github.com/jwesterinen/lras1130_pi

 4.  Build the lras1130_pi library:
       cd lras1130_pi
       make

 5.  Build and run any of the example applications:
       cd ../examples/MovingPixel
       cp ../../lras1130_pi/applications/Makefile .
       <modify the Makefile to define the TARGET as the name of the application>
       make
       ./MovingPixel

 6.  Create an application of you own using the Lucky Resistor API.  Simply use
     the application Makefile provided.
